I take this opportunity to express my deep sense of gratitude to the Almighty and sincere thanks to all who helped me to complete the seminar successfully. 

I express my sincere gratitude to \textbf{Dr. T. A. Shahul Hameed}, Principal, TKMCE, for providing me with all the necessary facilities and support for doing the seminar. 

I am extremely grateful to \textbf{Dr. Dimple A Shajahan}, Head of Department, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and \textbf{Prof. Thushara A}, Seminar Coordinator and Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, for their constructive guidance, advice, constant support, and technical guidance provided throughout the preparation of this seminar. Without their intellectual support and appropriate suggestions at the perfect time, this seminar would not have been possible. 

I extend my immense gratitude to all faculties and technical staff in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, for their help and necessary facilities to complete the seminar. My humble gratitude and heartiest thanks also go to my parents and friends, who have supported and helped me on the course of this work.
